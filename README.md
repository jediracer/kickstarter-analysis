# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in her kickstarter campaign by finding the optimal time to start the campaign as well as analyze the outcomes by goals.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- I created a chart that shows the outcomes of theater kickstarter campaigns based on their outcomes by the month in which they were launched.  This will help determine the optimal time of year to launch the campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- The second chart shows the percentage of outcomes based on the goal ranges.  This helps to determine which goal ranges are more successful than others.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- There were a few challenges with the data provided and require some manipulation to make it more useful and meaningful.  This was easily overcome using Excel formulas to split the ‘Category and Subcategory' field as well as converting the date in the ‘deadline’ & ‘launched_at’ fields.
## Results
- Based on the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date graph, it appears the best time to launch a campaign is in mid to late spring through mid to late summer (April-August).  Conversely, campaigns launched in September through March do not seem to have as good of results.
- Looking at the Outcomes Based on Goal graph, you can see a downward trend based on goal size.  The higher the goal, the less likely the campaign is successful.
- The data does not include the method of contact of donors.  This could be an important dataset to determine the most successful method to contact potential donors.
- With method of contact data, I would like to create a chart to determine the most successful method of contact. This could help in focusing efforts on the successful methods   of contacting potential donors, creating an overall more efficient and potential successful campaign.
